# Personal-Finance-Analysis

This was a fun side project I did outside of work to relearn some machine learning concepts as well as analyzing my finances ever since I got my first job out of college (September 1, 2021). I extracted datasets from my bank for my credit card and debit card, then loaded them into Jupyter Notebook where I cleaned the data and performed EDA. Then, I fitted a linear regression model to my debit card dataset to try and predict my bank balance. The highest accuracy I got was only 27%, which could be due to non-linearity of the response-predictor relationships, presense of outliers, errors in choosing features, or small sample of data. Overall, I have reviewed a lot of concepts I learned in school and looking forward to improving my skills in future projects.
